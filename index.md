## 4. Location Usage

### 4.1 Location Usage

Our app requires precise location permission (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) because:

Users maintain full control over location data:

- Location permission can be revoked at any time through device settings
- Can still use the app with location services disabled by manually selecting city and country
